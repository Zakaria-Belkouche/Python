						Conditional Statement Task:

Your company has organized a morale event! They're hosting a picnic and field day in the park, and of course, they want to play games! Team games! Team building games!

To do that they want to assign the attendees to certain teams based on their last name. They've already chosen the team names, but they want you to write a program that will sort each person into the correct team.

Here are the specs:

If a person's name starts with A, B, C, or D, then they are on the team "Red Dragons"
If the name starts with E, F, G, or H, they are on the team "Dark Wizards."
If the name starts with I, J, K, or L, they are on the team "Moving Castles."
If the name starts with M, N, O, or P, they are on the team "Golden Snitches"
If the name starts with Q, R, S, or T, they are on the team "Night Guards."
If the name stars with U, V, W, X, Y, or Z, they are on the team "Black Holes."





							Coffee Shop Task:


Write a program that will calculate the cost of a custom cup of coffee at a gourmet coffee shop, based on the size of 
the cup, the type of coffee selected, and flavors that can be added to the coffee. 

It should complete the following steps:

Ask the user what size cup they want, choosing between small, medium, and large.

Ask the user what kind of coffee they want, choosing between brewed, espresso, and cold brew.

Ask the user what flavoring they want, if any. Choices include hazelnut, vanilla, and caramel.

Calculate the price of the cup using the following values:

		Size:
small: $2
medium: $3
large: $4
		Type:
brewed: no additional cost
espresso: 50 cents
cold brew: $1
		Flavoring:
None: no additional cost
All other options: 50 cents

Display a statement that summarizes what the user ordered.

Display the total cost of the cup of coffee as well as the cost with a 15% tip, in phrases that explain the values to 
the user. 

Round the cost with tip to two decimal places.

For example, if the user asks for a medium-sized espresso with hazelnut flavoring, the total should be $4; the total 
with a tip should be $4.60.
