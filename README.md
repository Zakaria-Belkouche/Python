# Welcome to My Python Learning Repository!

This repository documents my ongoing journey of learning and mastering **Python**; from the fundamentals to more advanced concepts like **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **data manipulation**, and **automation**.


Each folder (sub-repository) within this project represents a specific **lesson**, **exercise**, or **project** Iâ€™ve completed as part of my learning process.

*Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore each folder. Every section includes its own README explaining the task and my approach.*
