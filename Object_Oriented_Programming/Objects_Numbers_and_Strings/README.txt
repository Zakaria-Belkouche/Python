The objective of this lab is to practice designing and implementing a program that has more than one class. To that end, you will build a basic calculator that allows the user to input two values and an operator and then outputs the results.

Instructions
Your program should include the following:

- Design a class called SimpleCalculator that performs basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two operands.
- Create a separate method for each operation in the class.
- The program should accept two values and an operator from the user, perform the selected operation using those two values, and display the result to the user in a meaningful way.
- The user should be able to exit the program at any time, using a keyword like "Quit" or "Exit" in any letter case.
- If the user chooses to exit, the program should end with an appropriate output message thanking the user.

Requirements:

- Include your name and a current date as a comment on the first line of the program.
Use appropriate names for all properties, methods, and so on, so that another developer can easily read the code to understand what it does.
- The program must accept user input in any letter case (lowercase, uppercase, or mixed) and work without error.
- All output to the user should use correct spelling and grammar and be meaningful to the user in the context.
