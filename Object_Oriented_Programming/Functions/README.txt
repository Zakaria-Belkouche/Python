Lesson 1 Self-Assessment: Counting Words

This assessment will allow you to:
- Demonstrate the use of function parameters, including the use of default values.
- Demonstrate the use of indefinite parameters in a function.
- Use keywords to define parameters in a function.

Instructions:

- For this assessment, you will write a program that takes a string of text as input from a user and then counts the number of times each distinct word appears in the text.
- Create a function that accepts the string as user input.
- The function should include all steps required to count the words in the string, including:
- Remove punctuation
- Identify the distinct words in the string.
- Add the words to a dictionary.
- Calculate the number of times each word appears.
- Store all of the count results in a dictionary.
- After processing the string, the function should display the dictionary to the user with a user-friendly message.

Requirements:

Include your name and a current date as a comment in the first line of code.
Use meaningful names throughout the code to make it easy for other developers to understand what each step of the code does.
All messages and feedback to the user must be meaningful and use correct spelling and grammar.
The function must accept the initial string in any case (uppercase, lowercase, or mixed) and produce the same results.
