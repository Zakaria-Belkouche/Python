						Assesment: Fizz Buzz

Output a count starting with 0.
Display the count number if it is not divisible by 3 or 5.
Replace every multiple of 3 with the word "fizz."
Replace every multiple of 5 with the word "buzz."
Replace multiples of both 3 and 5 with "fizz buzz."
Continue counting until the number of integers replaced with "fizz," "buzz," or "fizz buzz" reaches the input number.
The last output line should read "TRADITION!!"


For example:

How many fizzing and buzzing units do you need in your life? 7
0
1
2

4
buzz
fizz
7
8

						Text Count Analysis Task


This exercise asks you to combine the Python skills you have learned into a single application. We will start with a paragraph of text and end up with a frequency count of the distinct words in that text.

This assessment includes the following steps:

Convert a string to lowercase characters.

Split the lowercase string into individual words.

Count the number of words in the lowercase string.

Determine the number of distinct words in the lowercase string.

Calculate the number of times each word appears in the lowercase string.

Remove the punctuation from the lowercase string.

Perform a count analysis on the text without punctuation characters.

Complete each step individually, moving to the next step only after the current step works as expected. Because later steps depend on variables created in earlier steps, you may need to run all steps up to the current step before running the code in the current step. Jupyter Notebook includes a Run All Above command in the Cell menu that will allow you to run all previous steps, making the earlier variables available to the current cell.



Finally, create a single script that performs all of the following operations on the original s string.

Convert the string to lowercase characters.

Split the lowercase string into individual words.

Remove the punctuation from the lowercase words. Assume that all punctuation is either the first character or the last character of each item in the list.

Perform a count analysis on the words without punctuation characters.

Display the dictionary with the word counts and the number of distinct words in the original string.
